                        <p>Since 1875, this lighthouse has kept mariners from danger, night and day. The Keepers’ Dwelling has housed more than two dozen families, as their duties of “Lighthouse Keeper” were carried out. Today, our on-site keepers and staff continue the tradition: cleaning the lens, maintaining the structure and grounds, and most importantly, now – sharing it with you.</p>
